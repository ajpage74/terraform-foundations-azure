    Welcome to Terraform Foundations on Azure! Let's take a quick tour of your lab environment. If you look up at the top navigation bar of Instruqt you will see four tabs. Click each tab to explore the lab environment.

    Note: You can increase or decrease the text size in your lab environment with the `CTRL +` or `CTRL -` keyboard shortcuts Windows/Linux). Use the `CMD` key instead if you are on MacOS.

    You may hide this side panel. You won't need the **Check** button below until the very end of the lab.

    Use the right facing `>` button at the top of this sidebar to hide it.
